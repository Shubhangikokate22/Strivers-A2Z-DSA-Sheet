/*
Problem Statement: Given an integer N and an array of size N-1 containing N-1 
numbers between 1 to N. Find the number(between 1 to N),
that is not present in the given array.

For each number between 1 to N, we will try to find it in the given array 
using linear search. And if we donâ€™t find any of them, we will return the number.

complexities
Time Complexity: O(N2), where N = size of the array+1.
Reason: In the worst case i.e. if the missing number is N itself, the outer loop will run 
for N times, and for every single number the inner loop will also run for approximately N times.
So, the total time complexity will be O(N2).
Space Complexity: O(1)  as we are not using any extra space.
